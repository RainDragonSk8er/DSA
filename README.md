# The Tutorial

# The Language

The goal of this repo is to finish the tutorial with examples using the [C programming language](https://www.w3schools.com/c) with the g++ compiler.
Alternative languages i find to be fine are: [RUST](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), [ZIG](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/), [GO](https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_introduction.php), or [ODIN](https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/).

***BEST OF LUCK!!!***
